# 🔍 Smart Contract Audits — Full Code, Tests & Reports

This repository contains practical, in-depth smart contract audits — including the full codebase, unit & security tests, and detailed audit reports (in both `README.md` and `PDF` formats).

Whether you're a security researcher, developer, or hiring team — this repo demonstrates my auditing process, exploit identification, and secure development practices.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder represents a **separate audit case** and typically contains:

```code

├── audit.md            # Markdown version of the audit report
